## Ancient Greece: Where Being Gay Was Just... Normal

Forget everything you learned in high school history. Ancient Greece wasn't just tolerant of homosexuality — it was **celebrated, ritualized, and considered the highest form of love.**

Plato (the philosopher, not your AI assistant) literally argued in *Symposium* that love between men was more noble than love between men and women. The Sacred Band of Thebes — an elite military unit of 150 gay couples — was considered the fiercest fighting force in Greece. Lovers fought side-by-side, and dying for your boyfriend was the ultimate honor.

The Greeks didn't have a word for "homosexual" because they didn't need one. **Male beauty, male desire, male pleasure — this was just life.**

## The Body Beautiful: Gym Culture Started Here

![Greek Pottery Depicting Male Courtship](assets/greece-pottery.jpg)
*Attic red-figure pottery showing the erastes-eromenos (lover-beloved) relationship*

Greek men spent hours at the **gymnasium** (literally "place of nakedness") — wrestling, running, and lifting, all completely nude. This wasn't just about fitness. It was about **displaying the male form**, admiring other men's bodies, and cultivating physical perfection.

Sculptors immortalized this in marble: the **Doryphoros** (spear-bearer) with his perfect proportions, the **Kritios Boy** with his contrapposto stance, the **Riace Bronzes** with their chiseled abs and powerful thighs. These weren't just art — they were **ideals**. The Greeks worshipped the male body, and they weren't shy about it.

Sound familiar? Yeah, modern gay gym culture has ancient roots.

## Priapus: The God with the Giant Dick

![Priapus Statue from Ephesus](assets/greece-priapus.jpg)
*Priapus, god of fertility, with his permanently erect phallus — National Archaeological Museum of Athens*

The Greeks didn't just admire the phallus — they **deified it.**

**Priapus**, god of fertility and gardens, was depicted with a permanently erect, oversized cock. Statues of Priapus were placed in gardens, doorways, and public spaces. His giant dong wasn't vulgar — it was **protective, powerful, and sacred.**

Phallic sculptures and amulets were everywhere: in homes, in temples, worn as jewelry. The Greeks understood what we've always known: **the cock is divine.**

---

## Dildos? Absolutely.

While much of the historical record focuses on women's use of the **olisbos** (Greek dildo), the archaeological and literary evidence makes it clear: **men used them too.**

Greek pottery shows scenes of anal penetration. Ancient medical texts discuss the use of phallic objects for pleasure. And in a culture that worshipped the phallus and celebrated male-male desire, do you really think gay men weren't using dildos?

Materials ranged from:
- **Leather** — stitched, stuffed, and oiled
- **Wood** — carved, sanded smooth
- **Stone** — for the size queens of antiquity
- **Bronze** — because some men wanted the real weight

The city of **Miletus** was famous for producing the finest dildos in the ancient world. Think of it as the **Fort Troff of 500 BCE.**

## What DONCGO Learned from the Greeks

At DONCGO, we're not breaking new ground. We're **continuing a tradition** that's older than Christianity, older than the Roman Empire, older than the concept of "gay" itself.

The Greeks taught us:
- **The male body is sacred** — Worship it.
- **Pleasure is natural** — Don't apologize for it.
- **Craftsmanship matters** — A dildo should be as beautiful as it is functional.
- **Size matters (sometimes)** — See: Priapus.

Our debut dildo, **THE CASTRO**, is designed with the same reverence the Greeks had for the phallus: anatomically inspired, perfectly proportioned, built to last.

We're just using **platinum-cured silicone** instead of oiled leather.

- **Greek erotic pottery** — British Museum, Attic red-figure ware (yes, there's anal)
- **Plato's *Symposium*** — Philosophy's gayest text
- **The Sacred Band of Thebes** — 150 gay couples who died together at Chaeronea
- **Priapus sculptures** — Naples Archaeological Museum (NSFW even by museum standards)
- **The Riace Bronzes** — Two life-sized bronze warriors, perfectly naked, perfectly ripped

                content: `Alright, you magnificent queers and allies, buckle up — because today on the DONCGO blog, we're diving balls-deep into the life of **Paul Cadmus**, the unapologetic American artist who turned horny sailors into high art and gave zero fucks about the establishment's pearl-clutching. Born in 1904 in New York City to a family of artists, Cadmus didn't just paint pretty pictures; he captured the raw, throbbing pulse of gay desire in an era when most folks were still pretending it didn't exist. And let's be real, if there's one thing we at DONCGO love more than crafting dildos that hit the spot, it's celebrating icons who flipped off the prudes and kept the party going.

*"The Fleet's In!" (1934) — the painting that made the U.S. Navy lose its mind. Public domain, U.S. Naval Historical Center.*

## The Painting That Broke the Navy

Picture this: It's 1934, the Great Depression is sucking the life out of America, and Cadmus drops *The Fleet's In!* — a riotous oil painting bursting with sailors on shore leave, flirting outrageously with civilians in Riverside Park. These aren't your buttoned-up Navy boys; they're strutting, smoking, and getting handsy in ways that scream "liberty call!" There's a sailor eyeing a dapper gent like he's dessert, and the whole scene drips with that electric, pre-Stonewall tension.

Cadmus painted it for the Public Works of Art Project — taxpayer-funded gay art, essentially — and when it hit the Corcoran Gallery in Washington D.C., all hell broke loose.

## Enter the Outraged Admiral

Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman stormed the exhibition like a scorned ex and yanked the painting down faster than you can say "anchors aweigh." He called it **"disgraceful, sordid, disreputable"** — basically every homophobe's bingo card in three words. The scandal exploded in the press, turning Cadmus into an overnight sensation.

Did our boy back down? **Hell no.** He thanked the admiral for the free publicity and spent the next six decades cranking out more homoerotic gems: *YMCA Locker Room* (1934), his luminous *Ballet Dancers* series, and a career's worth of gloriously flesh-forward work. He even developed a mastery of egg tempera — that's right, he painted with *egg yolks* for that luminous Renaissance glow — talk about whipping something creamy into art history.

## Living Loudly

Cadmus lived openly with his partner Jared French for years — part of a circle of queer artists who called themselves "PaJaMa" (Paul, Jared, Margaret). He survived the McCarthy era's witch hunts without flinching, kept painting into his 90s, and died in 1999 at the age of 94. His work wasn't just art; it was a big, bold *fuck you* to censorship wrapped in impeccable technique and a wink. In a world that tried to shove gay desire back into the closet, Cadmus flung the doors wide open and invited everyone to the orgy.

The Navy eventually took *The Fleet's In!* back. It now hangs permanently at the Navy Art Gallery at the Washington Navy Yard. The admiral is dead. The painting lives on. **Gay wins again.**

                content: `In a world where homosexuality was once shrouded in secrecy and stigma, one artist's unapologetic vision shattered barriers and redefined what it meant to be proudly gay.  
**Tom of Finland** (born Touko Valio Laaksonen) wasn't just an illustrator—he was a revolutionary force who celebrated male desire, masculinity, and queer joy through his iconic homoerotic art.

## The Man Behind the Myth

Touko Laaksonen was born in 1920 in Finland, a time and place where homosexuality was illegal and deeply taboo.  
Yet from his early years, he drew inspiration from the rugged men around him—farmers, loggers, and soldiers—infusing his private sketches with a raw, erotic energy that would later explode onto the global stage.

Serving in World War II as a Finnish officer, Laaksonen encountered uniformed men that fueled his imagination, leading to drawings that exalted the hypermasculine form in leather, boots, and bulging confidence.

What makes Tom of Finland truly praiseworthy is how he transformed homosexuality from a hidden vice into a **celebrated virtue**. In an era of repression, his art portrayed gay men not as victims or stereotypes, but as strong, joyful, and sexually liberated heroes.

He challenged the effeminate caricatures prevalent in society, instead offering images of "bulgingly priapic cops and cowboys" that became symbols of gay liberation. Through series like his **"Kake" comics**, he created a visual language that resonated deeply within the gay community, fostering pride and acceptance.

## Empowering the Queer Community

Tom's contributions went far beyond aesthetics; he helped forge a new identity for gay men worldwide.  
His hypermasculine characters influenced how homosexuals perceived themselves and were perceived by others, breaking taboos around gay sex and promoting a sense of brotherhood.

In Finland, where laws against "deviant sexual behavior" lingered until the 1970s, his work addressed social stigmas head-on, paving the way for greater visibility and acceptance.

Artists and activists alike credit him with increasing the visibility of gay subjectivity, especially in the latter 20th century. His drawings didn't just arouse—they united a community, inspiring leather subcultures and influencing figures like Robert Mapplethorpe.

Even today, his legacy lives on through the **Tom of Finland Foundation**, which preserves his art and supports LGBTQ+ creators.

## A Lasting Legacy of Pride

Tom of Finland's homosexuality wasn't a footnote in his story—it was the bold, beating heart of his genius.  
By openly addressing and celebrating queer desire in a time of peril, he not only survived but thrived, leaving behind a world more accepting of love in all its forms.

His art continues to empower, reminding us that true liberation comes from embracing who we are, **unapologetically**.
