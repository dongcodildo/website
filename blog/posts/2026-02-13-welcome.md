## Our Mission

Made by hardcore homos, for hardcore homos. That's always been the mission since Rod and Hardy started this in **1978** at a Castro leather bar.

We don't do weak toys. We don't do boring. Every piece we make is built to last, tested on ourselves first, designed for men who play **hard**.

Stay tuned for more content. We're just getting started.
